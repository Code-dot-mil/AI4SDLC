# Futures Watch: Emerging Practices in AI-Augmented Software Engineering

## Overview

This play will explore future-facing trends and evolving practices that may reshape how software is designed, developed, and maintained in secure, mission-critical environments.

## Scope

Futures Watch will analyze:

- Agentic software engineering (AI agents coordinating SDLC tasks)
- Secure digital platforms with embedded GenAI capabilities
- The low-code/no-code shift for prompt-driven logic authoring
- Architectural implications for governance, composability, and trust calibration

## Relationship to Other Plays

This play builds upon:

- **Code Generation & Completion** – current best practices for AI-assisted authoring
- **Governance for Responsible GenAI Adoption** – anticipating policy and oversight needs

## Coming Soon

This play will include architectural patterns, design considerations, and risk tradeoffs associated with future GenAI integrations.

> This content is exploratory in nature and intended to inform long-range planning, R&D, and strategic readiness.
