### 1) What AI was used for (if any)
- Tool (Duo / Ask Sage / ChatGPT / Claude / Local LLM / Other):
- Purpose (requirements / design / security / codegen / review / test / docs / other):
- Scope (what AI did vs what humans did):

### 2) Boundaries and data handling
- [ ] Repo-only inputs (or explicitly approved external sources)
- [ ] No secrets / credentials / tokens / private keys
- [ ] No internal identifiers (hostnames/domains/usernames) unless explicitly approved
- Data sensitivity (org-defined): Public / Internal / CUI / Other: ___________

### 3) Artifacts produced (recommended)
Link to any AI-assisted work products saved in-repo:
- Requirements: `docs/ai/requirements/...`
- Design/ADR: `docs/ai/design/...`
- Security (threat model, controls): `docs/ai/security/...`
- Test plan: `docs/ai/tests/...`
- Review notes: `docs/ai/reviews/...`

### 4) Verification and evidence
- Tests run:
- Security checks run (SAST/SCA/SBOM/etc. if applicable):
- How to reproduce/validate:
- Key risks and mitigations:

### 5) Assumptions (UNVERIFIED where applicable)
- ...

### 6) Review expectations
- [ ] Assumptions labeled (UNVERIFIED where needed)
- [ ] Risks documented (including security/compliance when relevant)
- [ ] Verification steps included
- [ ] Human reviewer is accountable for final decision/merge
