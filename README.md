# AI4SDLC DoD CIO Guidance

This repository supports the creation and publication of MkDocs-based guidance developed under the **AI for Software Development Lifecycle (AI4SDLC)** initiative led by the **DoD CIO**. It is part of an ongoing effort to provide secure, mission-aware adoption practices for Generative AI (GenAI) within U.S. Department of Defense software delivery environments.

## üìö About This Site

This site is designed using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). It provides modular, evolving guidance‚Äîreferred to as *Plays*‚Äîto help teams and leadership safely and effectively integrate GenAI into all phases of the software development lifecycle.

### Key Themes:
- Trust, traceability, and accountability in GenAI-assisted workflows
- Role-specific prompting practices and augmentation patterns
- Pipeline-integrated verification, validation, and policy enforcement
- Secure use of GenAI in classified, mission-critical, and export-controlled environments
